# check-bitcoin-balance

## Description

This Python script, `check_balance.py`, helps you efficiently check the balance of multiple Bitcoin addresses and save the results to a file. It utilizes the Blockchain.info API to retrieve balance information.

**Features:**

* Processes addresses in batches for improved performance.
* Handles potential changes in the API response structure.
* Logs errors and informational messages for troubleshooting.
* Writes results with formatted addresses and balances.
* Supports addresses with zero balance.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3
* Libraries: `requests`, `json`, `logging` (can be installed using `pip install requests json logging`)

## Usage

1. Save the script as `check_balance.py`.
2. Prepare a text file containing your Bitcoin addresses, one per line.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script and the address file.
4. Run the script with your input and output file paths:

```
python check_balance.py input.txt output.txt
```

* Replace `input.txt` with the actual path to your file containing Bitcoin addresses.
* Replace `output.txt` with the desired path for the output file that will store the balance information.

The script will check the balances, log any errors, and save the results to the specified output file.
